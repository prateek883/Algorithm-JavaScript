# Time Complexity
O (n*2) => Worst-case.
Array is in descending order. And you are sorting in Asc order.
Now the swap function runs in every iteration.
# Space Complexity
O(1)
 
# Points
1. Iterate over entire array and swap items if one is bigger than the other.
2. Bubble sort is the worst type of sort because it compares every pair possible
