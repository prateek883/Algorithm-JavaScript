# Time Complexity
O(logN)

# Space Complexity
O(1) -> Same space for any number for the input n.

# Points

1. Works only on sorted array.

# Steps:

1. Check the mid value.

2. If mid value is small, search in the smaller part.

3. If mid value is big, search in the bigger part.

4. Repeat until a single value is obtained.
