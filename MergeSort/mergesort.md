# Time Complexity
O(NlogN) // base2
 
# Space Complexity
O(n)
 
# Points
1. Usually done recursively.
2. Divide and conquer.
 
 
# Steps
1. Divide the array into individual arrays until array has 1 item each.
2. Merge 2 items and keep creating sub arrays.
3. Merge the sub arrays to get the final array. (use recursion)
