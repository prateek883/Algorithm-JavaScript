# Time Complexity
O(N*2)
# Space Complexity
O(1)
 
# Points
1. Selection sorting works by scanning the elements for the smallest element and inserting it into the current position of the array.
2. Better than Bubble sort. 
 
# Steps
1. set currentMinimumIndex and start comparing it with rest of items.
2. If any item is < currentMinimum , set it as currentMinimumIndex and continue iteration until minimum is found.
3. If new currentMin is found in the iteration, swap it.
