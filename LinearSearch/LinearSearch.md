# Time Complexity
O(n) -> Because at worst case, the function needs to execute n times.
 
# Space Complexity
O(1) -> Same space for any number for the input n
 
# Points
1. Goes through each element of the array one by one sequentially.
2. Linear search doesn't need sorting.
3. So if array is sorted, better to use other techniques like binary search
